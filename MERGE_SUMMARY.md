  - `--input-background`
  - `--muted-background`

## Security & Access Control
- Admin access properly gated using `USER_ROLES.ADMIN` constant
- Access denied page for non-admin users
- Proper role checks throughout the interface

## UI/UX Improvements
- Modern, professional design with smooth animations
- Responsive layout that works on mobile devices
- Loading states and empty state handling
- Consistent color scheme using CSS variables
- Intuitive tab-based navigation

## Testing Status
✅ **Project builds successfully** - No compilation errors
✅ **Development server runs** - Available on localhost:5175
✅ **No import/export conflicts** - All dependencies resolved
✅ **CSS variables resolved** - All styling working correctly
✅ **Constants properly imported** - Using proper USER_ROLES

## Breaking Changes
None - All existing citizen-side functionality preserved.

## Next Steps
1. Test admin functionality with actual database
2. Verify Supabase Row Level Security (RLS) policies for admin operations
3. Test user authentication with admin role assignment
4. Verify all admin actions work with real data

## Notes
- The original `frnd` folder can be safely removed after verification
- All admin functions depend on proper Supabase setup and RLS policies
- Admin user role must be assigned in the database for testing
